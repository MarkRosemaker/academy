This is an interactive **video**.

At the bottom you can see several icons. Click on the first icon in the lower left, the play icon, to start or continue the video.

Click on the bookmark icon to see the bookmarks. If you click on a bookmark, you jump to that time in the video.

With the speedometer you can change the **speed**. You can turn on the **subtitles** by clicking on "CC".

Some videos contain small exercises. The instructions are in German, but are easy to understand or to guess. [Look up unknown words](https://www.dict.cc/) so that you are well prepared next time.

The videos are immersion exercises. So watch them **with German subtitles**, as long as this is not too difficult. This will also teach you how to write the words.

Make sure you **know what the video is about**. The English subtitles can help you with that -- but as I said, just use them if it's *necessar*.

If you're having trouble, watch the video at slow speed.

Take a look at the video **without subtitles**. This is how you learn to understand the words properly without any additional help.

Then watch the video (with and without subtitles) **several times** until you have internalized the meanings of all vocabulary words.

Finally watch the video at **1.5x speed** or even faster. Some Germans speak very fast, but through this exercise you can also understand such people. :muscle:

In summary, you've seen the video at least three times in the end, and more than four times in the case of difficulties:

- with English subtitles (optional)
- at 0.5 times speed (optional)
- with German subtitles
- without subtitles
- at 1.5 times speed

The **main thing** in this lesson is that you learn German automatically and while being relaxed. My body language and visual aids help you to guess the meanings of the words.
