This is an exercise, a **quiz**.

It is important that we review your knowledge at regular intervals. This way, we make sure that you continue to make progress.

We also make sure that you don't forget the knowledge you have learned.

**Important:** Repeat this exercise until you can answer all questions 100&#160;% correctly.

If you're getting bad results on a quiz, that's not so bad. Go back to relevant previous lessons and just do them again.

If this does not help, **please let me know** and I will help you solve the problem.

Remember: It's *not bad* to not know something. It is *not bad* to make mistakes.

It would only be bad to do nothing about it -- and you can do something about it! With determination and patience, you can improve! :smiley: :muscle: :sunglasses:

The **main thing** in this lesson is that you challenge yourself, allow mistakes to happen, and learn from them.
