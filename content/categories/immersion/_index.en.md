This is a pure **immersion exercise**.

At first, ignore the translation completely. Read only the German text and listen to the audio recording. Try to guess the meaning of the German words.

Read the translation if you cannot guess the meaning of a word or sentence.

Then listen to the audio file with your eyes closed and try to understand the words.

Important words are highlighted in yellow. Listen to this lesson several times and learn the vocabulary in this way instead of memorizing it.

Listen to and read this lesson {{% ul %}}at least twice{{% /ul %}}.

The **main thing** in this lesson is that your brain automatically and *subconsciously* recognizes the patterns -- words in context as well as grammatical patterns.
