  - randomize on build, then randomize with Javascript
  - make it more insistent over time: wiggle, show popup after percentage scrolled, percentage of video seen (see script for ConvertKit, Google Tag Manager)


- write [beginner course](https://workflowy.com/#/9f92ea0ffc1a)
  - if not checked for errors, paste clean text instead to check
  - Checkliste/Studienplan für 1h/5h Zeitinvestment pro Tag: wann welche Lektionen absolviert, wann welche Quizlet-Einheiten absolviert, wann Immersionsübungen zum zweiten Mal etc. (c.f. [Benny's Lift plan](https://lift.do/plans/452/learn-to-speak-a-foreign-language))

  - social and cultural integration
    - I'm not your brother!
    - "made a note of everything that made Egyptian men about my age different from me. How they walked, how they used their hands, the clothing they wore, their facial expressions, the volume they’d speak at, how they’d groom themselves, and much more [...] Really try to analyze everything that someone of your age and gender is doing, and see if you can mimic it next time you are speaking."



TODO catch up things I couldn't do without internet:
- chrome plugin http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrEzKtjKVio -> a plugin for Chrome that eases you into the language by translating some parts of the sites you normally read in English, to sprinkle the odd word into your otherwise English reading.
- congates in German

# Notes on beginner course (for sales etc.):

- Pareto principle: it doesn't take that long to make yourself understood ([pareto principle](https://tim.blog/2014/03/21/how-to-learn-a-foreign-language-2/))
- why most people fail: overwhelmed by the amount they *think* they need to learn
- learning is an adventure



- add cta on free course, then publish on multiple sites like teachable (more reach and figure out which site is best)
- improve emails
- show to people and get feedback
- check for and fix errors, e.g.
  - delete just [1] as translation, better yet: try to extract the translation from the English entry
  - remove empty entry like in 'erraten'
  - 'Ähnliche Wörter' wie bei "erraten" (und alles unter <div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:0em; border-top:1px solid #AAAAAA;".*?>) gehören nicht zu einer Wortart
  - Grammatische Merkmale soll immer einklappbar sein (nicht wie "reine", mögliche Lösung: '</ul><ul>' entfernen)
  - im zweiten Modus
    - benutze ::after, um FontAwesome-Symbol in Klammern in notices einzufügen
  - im dritten Modus (siehe Sandbox)
    - "Substantiv" und "Verb" ausschließen
    - benutze ::before und ::after, um  Instanzen des dritten Wortes in notices mit Sternchen zu versehen
    - mache Instanzen der dritten Wortart grün wenn es auch Substantiv oder Verb ist
    - was ist "Wort" und "Wörter" als Wortart?
    - 2. Person Singular sollte nicht Wortart sein
  - stop jumping to top when I click on something
  - Bilder: netlifly-URL, dann auf netlifly-Seite zugreifen


- improve js: jquery mobile (as soon as downloader works again)
  - https://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
  - close on clicking outside
  - don't jump to top on click

 The kind of subjects I am referring to are about German life, talk about where you live in Berlin, the places you have visited and/or lived in, the education system in Germany or what family life is like there.  I listen to National Public Radio and they bring up all kinds of subject matter from all over the world.

# Live Calls

- identify and solve **specific issues**
- teach German phrases so they can ask in German:
  - "Was bedeutet ...?"
  - "Wie benutzt man ...?"
  - "Wie sagt man ... auf Deutsch?"
- types of questions to ask
  - NOT "What's the difference between X and Y?" -> will only parrot back dictionary entry that the student can look up themselves
  - INSTEAD: "What's more common? Which would you say, this or this? What are some usage examples?"
- exercise
  - student writes a bio beforehand (one page): age, native country, town, what I do, siblings and their age, what they do, what parents do
  - I then translate that for them
  - student reads bio out loud, circles any pronunciation problems -> then student works on these sounds (with the help of private sessions)
- practice constructions (Hauptsatz, Nebensatz, Fragen,Konjunktiv)
  - I give words, they form the sentence (e.g. million dollars, Ferrari -> If I had a million dollars, I would buy a Ferrari.)
- "I may start a session by asking what my native friend or teacher did over the weekend, and tell them what I did. Then I will share something that is on my mind lately and attempt to express my opinion on it, or allow the native speaker to introduce a new topic. It’s important to take an active role and make sure you are having varied conversations. Have a list of topics you would like to discuss and bring them up (your hobbies, hopes for the future, dislikes, what you will do on your vacation etc.) and make sure the conversation is constantly progressing."
- motivation: what are your S.M.A.R.T. goals - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound. ( keep your priorities clear to avoid frustration)
- prepare for test: http://www.goethe.de/lrn/prj/pba/bes/enindex.htm


# Make Video (both in German with subtitles and in English)

Hi, I'm Mark from Authentic German Learning!

I'm so excited that you decided to take this course and are ready to learn German! I'm passionate about teaching you. So let's get started!

In this video, I'm going to explain my teaching method, the structure of the course, the interface, how you can contact me, and what you can do when you get stuck. Finally, I will review the guarantee conditions that you agreed to if you purchased that option.
Feel free to jump ahead if you alread know some of these things.

Save the bookmark to this video and go back to it if you are experiencing any issue, like not knowing .

## How the course works

### Immersion technique

As you will quickly see when you start, this course works with the immersion technique or natural method.

Super quick summary: You immerse yourself in the language as much as possible. You read and listen to as much German as you can.
You learn like a baby learns its native tongue.

That is why the course content is in German. No worries, you can always click on a button to see the translation.
In the beginning, this feature will be essential because of course you don't know much German *yet*. However, you will notice as time goes on that you will need the translation less and less.

*Please be patient* with yourself during this process.
Sure, I could tell you now to memorize words and you would *sort of* be able to speak. However, by immersing yourself and not always translating word for word, you do yourself a big favor in the long run.

By far the biggest issue that German learners have today is that they don't speak fluently enough and have problems with the grammar. (They tell me so all the time.)

That's why I would like to encourage you to always
- first try to infer the meaning of a word from context.
- If you can't,
- *and* the sentence doesn't make sense without you knowing the meaning,
- please only then look up the word.

In the beginning, you will look up almost every word *and that's okay*.
Later, you will ideally understand about 70 to 80 % of the text while *just noticing* the other 20 to 30 % without looking up *any* words.

# Structure of the course

## What to do when you have a question

Ask me! I'm always available for questions.

Please ask in a group setting because then other people get to hear my answer as well. This way, they will learn as well.
Plus, you are probably not alone with your question.

Always feel free to send me a message, no matter which medium you prefer. I will put all the ways to contact me below.

## What do do when you get stuck

If at any point you get overwhelmed and discouraged, take a step back and breathe, both literally and metaphorically. This is very important!

I want you to have fun, I want you to explore, I want you to play. That's why I created this course the way I did, where you can immerse yourself in the language, click on words and don't have to memorize stuff.

Instead of having a rigid structure where you have to learn words by heart or solve boring exercises, you can simply explore the language by reading and listening to interesting and inspiring stuff.

So, if you get discouraged, why not jump around in this course, why not rely more on the translation? Maybe you'd also like to take a break and come back another time. Do whatever brings back that joy that you had when you first thought about learning German and got excited.

This is important because if you are not having fun, if you don't have a good feeling associated with the language, it's actually scientifically proven that you learn much less efficiently. It's called an affective filter, Prof. Stephen Krashen talked about this.

## Guarantee conditions

- read and listened to each unit at least twice, listened to the audio on the go

# TODO Higher Levels Coaching Plan

- later levels: encourage to buy their favorite series in German
- "To get this high-level practice, I’ve subscribed to newspapers on my Kindle that I try to read every day from various major news outlets around the world. Here are the top newspapers in [Europe](http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=amb_link_353518862_21?ie=UTF8&node=2399044011&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=left-1&pf_rd_r=180J298JT8NRHYDNCWJS&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1628063482&pf_rd_i=165389011) [...]. After reading up on various topics, I like to get an experienced professional (and ideally pedantic) teacher to grill me on the topic, to force me out of my comfort zone, and make sure I’m using precisely the right words, rather than simply making myself understood."
- "For instance, I sat a C2 exam in German, and managed to hold my ground for the oral component, when I had to talk about deforestation for ten minutes, but I failed the exam on the listening component, showing me that I needed to be focused and pay attention to complicated radio interviews or podcasts at that level if I wanted to pass the exam in future."
