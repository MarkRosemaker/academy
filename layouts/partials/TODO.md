Hi, I'm Mark from Authentic German Learning!

I'm so excited that you decided to take this course and are ready to learn German! I'm passionate about teaching you. So let's get started!

## How the course works

### Immersion technique

As you will quickly see when you start, this course works with the immersion technique or natural method.

Super quick summary: You immerse yourself in the language as much as possible. You read and listen to as much German as you can.
You learn like a baby learns its native tongue.

That is why the course content is in German. No worries, you can always click on a button to see the translation.
In the beginning, this feature will be essential because of course you don't know much German *yet*. However, you will notice as time goes on that you will need the translation less and less.

*Please be patient* with yourself during this process.
Sure, I could tell you now to memorize words and you would *sort of* be able to speak. However, by immersing yourself and not always translating word for word, you do yourself a big favor in the long run.

By far the biggest issue that German learners have today is that they don't speak fluently enough and have problems with the grammar. (They tell me so all the time.)

That's why I would like to encourage you to always
- first try to infer the meaning of a word from context.
- If you can't,
- *and* the sentence doesn't make sense without you knowing the meaning,
- please only then look up the word.

In the beginning, you will look up almost every word *and that's okay*.
Later, you will ideally understand about 70 to 80 % of the text while *just noticing* the other 20 to 30 % without looking up *any* words.

## Structure of the course

The course consists of several types of lessons. Each lesson belongs to at least one category like:

- immersion
- instruction
- meta

### Immersion units

What I said before about immersion mostly applies to immersion units. These are units written in such a way that you will be most likely to understand many words.

In them, I make it easy for you to guess what I'm talking about. I use vocabulary words that are important for you to learn during the stage you are currently in.

The important words will be highlighted, so please make sure you know them all at the end of the unit.

### Instruction units

The instruction units will tell you more about

### Meta

such as resources

### Translating content

## What to do when you have a question

Ask me! I'm always available for questions.

Please ask in a group setting because then other people get to hear my answer as well. This way, they will learn as well.
Plus, you are probably not alone with your question.

Always feel free to send me a message, no matter which medium you prefer. I will put all the ways to contact me below.

## What do do when you get stuck

If at any point you get overwhelmed and discouraged, take a step back and breathe, both literally and metaphorically. This is very important!

I want you to have fun, I want you to explore, I want you to play. That's why I created this course the way I did, where you can immerse yourself in the language, click on words and don't have to memorize stuff.

Instead of having a rigid structure where you have to learn words by heart or solve boring exercises, you can simply explore the language by reading and listening to interesting and inspiring stuff.

So, if you get discouraged, why not jump around in this course, why not rely more on the translation? Maybe you'd also like to take a break and come back another time. Do whatever brings back that joy that you had when you first thought about learning German and got excited.

This is important because if you are not having fun, if you don't have a good feeling associated with the language, it's actually scientifically proven that you learn much less efficiently. It's called an affective filter, Prof. Stephen Krashen talked about this.
