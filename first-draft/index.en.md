## The Mission (TODO I added something to the German, compare!)

Hello, I am Mark from Authentic German Learning.

I want you to not only learn the German language successfully, but also have fun with it.

I want to make learning German the highlight of your day.

The German language is beautiful, very expressive and is rightly called the language of poets and thinkers.

I do not want to ruin this beauty by presenting you boring lessons.

And I also don't want to -- as is unfortunately the case with many traditional schools --, put too much emphasis on grammar and correctness to a point where it confuses you and blocks you from speaking.

No -- I want you to learn .- German in an authentic and enjoyable way so that you can speak for yourself without inhibitions soon.

I will explain the German grammar in a comprehensible way and show you ways, how you will not be overwhelmed by it.

Since 2015 I teach German and have taught over 10,000 German learners. As a native speaker, it hurts me that some of you are very frustrated, have massive problems talking to yourself and losing more and more of your passion for this beautiful language over time.

I want to prevent this for you right at the beginning. That's why I've created these courses to bring you closer to your goal.

You will immerse yourself in the German language with this course and get a feeling for them that would otherwise only have native speakers.

I only work with people who are willing to leave behind old ways of thinking and be part of the language learning revolution.

If you are such a person, you will gain much from this course.

Here we go!

Enjoy learning and enjoy the beauty of the German language.

# The Sheep and the Horses

[On a hill,] a sheep that had no wool saw horses, one of them pulling a heavy wagon, one carrying a big load, and one carrying a man quickly.

The sheep said to the horses: "My heart pains me, seeing a man driving horses."

The horses said: "Listen, sheep, our hearts pain us when we see this: a man, the master, makes the wool of the sheep into a warm garment for himself. And the sheep has no wool."

Having heard this, the sheep fled into the plain.
