==German==
[[File:Mädchen 1.jpg|thumb|right|220px|ein '''Mädchen''']]

===Alternative forms===
* {{l|de|Mägdchen}} {{qualifier|obsolete}}

===Etymology===
[[Appendix:Glossary#diminutive|Diminutive]] of a word for “girl” at hand in modern {{m|de|Magd||female servant}} and its variant {{m|de|Maid}} (now poetic “girl”). The form is thus analyzable as {{suffix|de|Magd|chen}} with simplification of the consonant cluster. It spread from {{etyl|gml|de}} {{m|gml|mēgedeken}}, {{m|gml|mechdeken}} (15th, early 16th centuries) to dialects of [[Central German]], thence beginning to replace older terms like {{m|de|Dirne}} (now “whore”, except dialectally). Similar formations are [[Upper German]] {{m|de|Mädel}}, {{cog|nl|meisje}}, and {{cog|en|maiden}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|de|/ˈmɛːtçən/}} {{qualifier|prescriptive standard; used naturally in western Germany and Switzerland}}
* {{IPA|de|/ˈmeːtçən/}} {{qualifier|overall more common; particularly northern and eastern regions}}
* {{audio|de|De-Mädchen.ogg|audio}}

===Noun===
{{de-noun|n|Mädchens|Mädchen}}

# [[girl]]
# [[maiden]]

====Usage notes====
* Since ''Mädchen'' is a grammatically neuter noun, all preceding articles, determiners, and adjectives take neuter forms: ''<u>ein</u> klein<u>es</u> Mädchen'' (“a little girl”). This rule is followed throughout all registers of German.
* There is more variation concerning pronouns referring back to ''Mädchen''. These are usually neuter within the same sentence: ''Das Mädchen, <u>das</u> eben hier war, hat <u>seine</u> Tasche vergessen.'' – “The girl who was just here, forgot her purse.” (But feminine {{m|de|ihre}} would be acceptable in colloquial usage.) It is quite common, however, to use feminine pronouns in following sentences: ''Siehst du das Mädchen, <u>das</u> da steht? Kennst du <u>die</u>?'' – “Do you see the girl who [''neuter''] is standing there? Do you know her [''feminine'']?” (But neuter {{m|de|es}} would be acceptable in literary usage.)
* ''Mädchen'' is typically used to refer to young women up to the age of 20 (or 25 at most). Past this age it is uncommon (unlike {{cog|en|girl}}).
