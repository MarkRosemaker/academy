{{also|mussen|muessen}}
==German==

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|goh|de}} {{m|goh|muozan}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|de}} {{m|gem-pro|*mōtaną}}. The closeness to the original diphthong can for example still be seen in the Bavarian first and third person singular, where one says I muas (I must) or Ea/Si/Es muas (He/she/it must).

====Usage notes====
* {{m|de||Müssen}} can express the necessity of doing something, but also the moral duty. {{m|de|sollen|Sollen}} expresses moral duty or the suggestion that something ought to be done. Both verbs can express a duty imposed by someone else. In this case ''müssen'' is stronger than ''sollen'', implying that the imposing person has some kind of power to make the other really do it.
* As shown in the first line, the infinitive is used instead of the past participle in the compound tenses if the verb has a complement verb. The phenomenon is called double infinitive.
:: ''Das hätten wir machen '''müssen'''.''
::: ''We should have done that.''
* In southern German and Austrian speech, the infinitive is often used instead of the past participle in any construction. Thus: ''ich habe nicht müssen'' for standard ''ich habe nicht gemusst.''
* As shown in the example above, {{m|de||nicht müssen}} translates into English as “need not” rather than “must not”. For the English “must not”, use {{m|de|dürfen|nicht dürfen}}.
* Before 1996, several of the conjugated forms of {{m|de||müssen}} were spelled with an {{m|de|ß}} (that is, {{m|de|muß}}, {{m|de|mußte}}, {{m|de|müßte}}, etc.). Since the spelling reform of 1996, however, the acceptable spelling is with {{m|de||ss}}.
