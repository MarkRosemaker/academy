{{also|Lieben}}
==German==

===Etymology===
Formally from {{inh|de|gmh|lieben}}, alteration (based on {{m|gmh|liep}}) of rarer {{m|gmh|liuben|t=to make or be dear, to treat in a friendly way}}, from {{inh|de|goh|liuben}}. While the singularily attested {{m+|goh|liobōn|t=to love}} probably remained without continuation, the modern sense was derived in late Middle High German from the noun {{m|de|liebe|t=love}} on the model of {{m|gmh|minnen|t=to love}}, from {{m|gmh|minne}}, which latter had developed a sexual overtone. It remained absent from most traditional dialects, which use variants of {{m|de|lieb haben}} or {{m|de|gern haben}} instead (compare the usage note below). Related with {{cog|en|love}}.

====Usage notes====
* German is more reluctant in its use of ''lieben'' (“to love”) than is English, particularly in reference to things. Such phrases as “''Ich liebe den Teppich in deinem Zimmer!''” (“I love the carpet in your room!”) are a typical feature of “dubbing German”, i.e. literal translations from English as commonly found in [[dub|dubbed]] films or sitcoms. A more native way of expressing the same in German would be “''Der Teppich in deinem Zimmer sieht super aus!''”, or “''Der Teppich in deinem Zimmer gefällt mir sehr gut!''”, or something along these lines.
* Even when referring to love between people, ''lieben'' may have a slightly solemn sound. A more normal way of expressing it in spoken German is {{m|de|lieb haben}}, particulary among friends and family, but usually also between lovers. (See the latter lemma for more.)
