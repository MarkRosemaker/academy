====Usage notes====
* Past participle superlatives that express a degree can be formed in the normal way, that is with the suffix {{m|de|-st}}: ''die <u>zerstörteste</u> Stadt'' (“the most destroyed city”). Alternatively, ''am meisten'' can be used before the positive form: ''die <u>am meisten zerstörte</u> Stadt''. (The latter is only possible with participles.)
* There may be a semantic difference between a superlative with ''meist-'' and a normal superlative (though this is not the case with every past participle and generally is not often relevant in practice). Compare:
:: ''die zerstörteste Stadt (= die am meisten zerstörte Stadt)'' — the city that was most destroyed at a given point in time
:: ''die meistzerstörte Stadt (= die am'' {{m|de|häufigsten}} ''zerstörte Stadt'') — the city that was most often destroyed in its history
* Double superlatives with both the prefix ''meist-'' and the suffix ''-st'' are not seldom encountered: ''das <u>meist</u>gelesen<u>ste</u> Buch''. This is regarded nonstandard usage in the formal register, but need not strike people as ungrammatical in informal use.
