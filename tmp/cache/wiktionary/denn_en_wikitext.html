{{also|Denn|dënn}}
==German==

===Etymology===
Old variant of {{m|de|dann}}. The functional split between ''denn'' and ''dann'' was prescribed only by the grammarians of the 18th century. Cognate with {{cog|en|then}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|de|/dɛn/|[dɛn]}}
* {{audio|de|De-denn.ogg|Audio}}

===Conjunction===
{{head|de|conjunction}}

# [[for]]; [[because]]; [[since]]
# {{lb|de|after a comparative}} [[than]]

====Usage notes====
The normal conjunction after a comparative is '''{{m|de|als}}'''; ''denn'' is generally archaic. Only in two cases is it still found in contemporary German:
* before ''als'' meaning “as, like”, in order to avoid reduplication: ''Er war nie glücklicher '''denn''' als kleiner Junge.'' — “He was never happier than as a little boy.” This usage is <u>formal</u>.
* before {{m|de|je||ever before}}: ''Er ist glücklicher '''denn''' je.'' — “He is happier than ever before.” This usage is normal or only slightly formal. The combination ''als je'' is not common, but one can say ''als je zuvor''.

===Adverb===
{{de-adv}}

# {{lb|de|in a question}} [[then]]; [[ever]]; [[but]]; ''used for emphasis or to express surprise''
#: ''Wo ist er '''denn'''?'' - "Where is he, then?" ("Where ever can he be?")
#: ''Wieso '''denn'''?'' - "How so, then?"
#: ''Was '''denn'''?'' - "But what?"
# {{lb|de|rather|_|rare}} [[thus]], [[so]]; {{ngd|expresses a consequence; see usage notes}}
# {{lb|de|colloquial|regional|northern Germany}} [[then]], after that, in that case

====Usage notes====
{{m|de|dann|Dann}} and {{m|de|denn}} are originally variants of the same word but came to be distinguished in modern German. ''Dann'' is an adverb with the basic meaning “then” (in the sense of “after that” or “in that case”). ''Denn'' is chiefly a conjunction meaning “because, for”. However, when ''denn'' is used as an adverb, the distinction from ''dann'' can be somewhat problematic.

* ''Dann'' and ''denn'' in questions:
: ''Denn'' is frequently used in questions to emphasize the questioner’s interest in the answer and often to express a degree of surprise:
:: ''Wir machen jetzt Mittag. — Seid ihr '''denn''' schon fertig?''
:: We’re off to lunch now. — But are you done already?
: ''Dann'' is less frequent in questions, but it can express that the question is based on an assumption:
:: ''Wir machen jetzt Mittag. — Seid ihr '''dann''' schon fertig?''
:: We’re off to lunch now. — So are you already done then?

* ''Dann'' and ''denn'' meaning “thus”:
: The normal words for “thus, so” expressing a consequence are {{m|de|also}} and (literary) {{m|de|somit}}. However, both ''dann'' and ''denn'' can also mean “thus”, chiefly when they are not the first word of the clause:
:: ''Angesichts dieser widerstrebenden Einflüsse verlief die Entwicklung des Landes '''dann/denn''' in der Tat recht ungewöhnlich.''
:: Given these conflicting influences, the development of the country thus took indeed a rather peculiar course.
: The difference here is very vague. ''Denn'' may slightly emphasize that there is an actual logical consequence between both facts.

* ''Dann'' and ''denn'' in regional speech:
: Colloquially, the distinction may not be strictly followed. Particularly, ''dann'' is used in questions in parts of western Germany and ''denn'' is used for “then” in parts of northern Germany:
:: ''Sin’ Se '''dann''' schon achtzehn?'' (“Are you even eighteen yet?”) — [[Rhineland]]
:: ''Na, '''denn''' man los!'' (“So then let’s go!”) — [[Lower Saxony]], [[Hamburg]], etc.
