* ''Tschüss'' was originally common only in northern and central Germany, but it has gained wider acceptance and is now also commonly used in southern Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and {{w|South Tyrol}}. The farewell {{m|de|auf Wiedersehen}} is often considered more appropriate to use towards strangers and generally in formal situations in Southern Germany. In northern and central Germany, ''tschüss'' is a standard goodbye in all but official situations, with the north preferring the older form ''tschüß''.
