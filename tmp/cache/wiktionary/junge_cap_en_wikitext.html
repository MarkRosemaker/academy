{{also|junge}}
==German==

===Alternative forms===
* {{l|de|Jung}} {{qualifier|colloquial, regional}}

===Etymology===
Nominalisation of {{m|gmh|jung||young}}. Already occasionally in {{etyl|gmh|de}}, later fully nominalised with the invariable nominative ''ein Junge'' (instead of ''ein'' {{m|de|Junger}}). The recognition as the normal standard term for “boy” is based on [[Central German|Central]] and [[Low German]] usage and has only fully asserted itself during the 20th century (compare {{m|de|Knabe}}). The now quite common plural form ''Jungs (Jungens)'' is also from {{etyl|nds-de|de}}. Cognate with {{cog|en|young}} {{qual|n.}}.

====Usage notes====
* The normal plural in writing is '''''Jungen''''', although the colloquial ''Jungs'' is also sometimes seen.
* The third plural ''Jungens'' is not all too frequent and chiefly restricted to northern and (parts of) central Germany.
* Even with the irregular plurals (''Jungs, Jungens'') the singular declension is always weak (thus with ''-n'' in the [[oblique case]]s of the singular).
