====Usage notes====
* The German ''Sie'' expresses [[w:T-V distinction#German|distance]] in the relation between two persons. It is not perfectly correct to say that it expresses respect. {{m|de||Sie}} has never been used to address gods and saints. Towards parents it was only briefly used during the 18th century by some of the upper classes. (In both of these cases, however, {{m|de|Ihr}} was formerly possible alongside {{m|de|du}}.) Even royal highnesses used to be addressed as ''du'', albeit not personally but in songs and poems (compare the famous {{w|Heil dir im Siegerkranz}}).
* ''Sie'' is identical in form to the third person plural pronoun {{m|de|sie||they}} and takes the same verb form. The "polite" ''Sie'' is distinguished in writing by capitalization. The only form which is not capitalized is the reflexive {{m|de|sich}}. When addressing a person with ''Sie'', one generally needs to replace the third person plural pronoun with the demonstrative {{m|de|die}} to avoid confusion: ''Wissen Sie, was '''die''' zu mir gesagt haben?'' − “Do you know what they said to me?”

====Inflection====
{{de-decl-personal pronouns}}

* The genitive case ''Ihrer'' is more and more rarely used in modern German.
* The genitive case ''Ihrer'' does not express ownership, so it must not be confused with the possessive pronoun ''[[Ihr]]'', which is declined by gender, singular/plural and case.
