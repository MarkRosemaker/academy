====Usage notes====
* The difference between the plurals ''Euro'' and ''Euros'' is equivalent to the difference between [[pence]] and [[pennies]] in English: The unchanged plural is used to mean an amount or value, whereas ''Euros'' may be used when referring to a number of coins. However, the unchanged plural can be used for the latter meaning as well.
* A third plural {{m|de|Euronen}} is restricted to jocular use (based on such pairs as {{m|de|Pharao}} → {{m|de||Pharaonen}}). Rarely, a new singular {{m|de|Eurone}} {{g|m}}, {{g|f}} may be backformed.
