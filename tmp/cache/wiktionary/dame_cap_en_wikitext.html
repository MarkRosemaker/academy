====Usage notes====
Concerning the use of the word as a polite term for any woman, note the following tendencies:
* It is common to refer to a woman as ''Dame'' when one speaks of her in her presence. {{m|de|Frau}} might even be slightly impolite in such a context.
:: ''Ich glaube, die '''Dame''' war vor mir dran.'' — “I think this '''lady''' was in line before me.”
* ''Dame'' used as a general term of address (“die Dame!” – ''madam!''), or when speaking about someone who is not present, marks a consciously polite way of speaking, most often heard from waiters, shop assistants, etc. In popular speech, it may be used to refer to an elderly woman but rarely to a young or middle-aged one.
* ''Dame'' is common in some specific contexts, such as ballroom dancing.
