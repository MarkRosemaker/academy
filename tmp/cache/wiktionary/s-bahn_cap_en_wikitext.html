===Etymology===
Abbreviation of {{m|de|Schnellbahn}}, from {{m|de|schnell||fast}} + {{m|de|Bahn||track, train}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|de|/ˈɛsˌbaːn/}}
* {{audio|de|De-S-Bahn.ogg|Audio}}

===Noun===
{{de-noun|f|S-Bahn|S-Bahnen}}

# [[suburban]] [[metro]] [[railway]] (usually overground), a fast local train
# [[S-train]]

====Usage notes====
* The ''S-Bahn'' is not to be confused with the {{m|de|Straßenbahn}}, which is a city-center train with many stops ([[tramway]]). In densely populated areas one will have to take the ''S-Bahn'' to get to the next city, and then switch to the local ''Straßenbahn'' to arrive at one's final destination. (Note that some traffic regions do not use ''S-Bahnen'', but have similar trains called, for example, {{m|de|Regionalbahn}}.)

====Related terms====
* {{l|de|U-Bahn}}
* {{l|de|Straßenbahn}}
