==German==

===Etymology===
From {{der|de|gmh|weinec}}, {{m|gmh|wēnec||marginal}}, from {{der|de|goh||*weinag}}, {{m|goh|wēnag||miserable}}, from {{der|de|gem-pro|*wainagaz}}. The form with {{m|goh||-ei-}} is original, that with {{m|goh||-ē-}} arose through conflation with the morphologically simpler Old High German {{m|goh|wē||woe}}, both akin to {{cog|en|woe}}. The diphthong {{m|goh||-ei-}} later on regularly became {{m|goh||-ē-}} in several dialects, which further strengthened the monophthongal form {{m|de||wenig}}. Cognate with {{cog|nl|weinig}}, {{cog|hrx|wenich}}, {{cog|yi|ווייניק}}.

The comparative {{m|de||minder}} comes from {{der|de|gmh|minder}}, {{m|gmh|minre}}, {{m|gmh|minner}}, the {{cog|gmh|-}} superlative is {{m|gmh|minnest}}, {{m|gmh|minst}}, both are related to {{m|gmh|min}}.

====Usage notes====
* The irregular compared forms ''minder, am mindesten'' are now restricted to formal usage where they are still commonly found as adverbs, chiefly in negation and especially when modifying adjectives. For example: ''nicht minder gefährlich'' – "no less dangerous", alongside: ''nicht weniger gefährlich''. Otherwise, only the regular forms are now commonly used.

====Declension====
* When not preceded by an article or determiner, ''wenig'' is usually left undeclined: ''wenig Geld'', ''wenig Kinder''. It may, alternatively, be declined in the plural: ''wenige Kinder''. The latter is preferable in the sense of “a small percentage of children”, while ''wenig Kinder'' is more common in the sense of “a small number of children”. Declined singular forms are possible in certain constructions, but are marginal.
* When preceded by an article or determiner, ''wenig'' is declined like a normal adjective: ''das wenige Geld'' (“the little [amount of] money”).
* The comparative forms behave like the positive forms, except that declined plural forms without a preceding article or determiner are very rare.
* The superlative forms are declined like normal adjectives.
