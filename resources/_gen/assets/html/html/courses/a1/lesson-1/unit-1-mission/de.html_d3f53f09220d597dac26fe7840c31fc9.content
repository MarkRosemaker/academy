The Mission</span><p>Hello, I am Mark of Authentic German Learning.</p><p>I&rsquo;m fine. Are you doing better?</p><p>Thanks for asking.</p><p>I want to go.</p><p>I go to you.</p><p>Hello, I am Mark of Authentic German Learning.</p><p>I want you to not only learn the German language successfully, but also have fun with it.</p><p>I want to make learning German the highlight of your day.</p><p>The German language is beautiful, very expressive and is rightly called the language of poets and thinkers.</p><p>I do not want to ruin this beauty by presenting you boring lessons.</p><p>And I do not want to, as is unfortunately the case with many traditional schools, that too much emphasis on grammar and correctness confuses you and blocks you from speaking.</p><p>No - I want you to learn German in an authentic and enjoyable way so that you can speak for yourself without inhibitions soon.</p><p>I will explain the German grammar in a comprehensible way and show you ways, how you will not be overwhelmed by it.</p><p>Since 2015 I teach German and have taught over 10,000 German learners. As a native speaker, it hurts me that some of you are very frustrated, have massive problems talking to yourself and losing more and more of your passion for this beautiful language over time.</p><p>I want to prevent this for you right at the beginning. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve created these courses to bring you closer to your goal.</p><p>You will immerse yourself in the German language with this course and get a feeling for them that would otherwise only have native speakers.</p><p>I only work with people who are willing to leave behind old ways of thinking and be part of the language learning revolution.</p><p>If you are such a person, you will gain much from this course.
Here we go!</p><p>key to success: Enjoy learning and enjoy the beauty of the German language.</p>
